This scenario has one error in each of the 6 upload files:

(Note that preferences.txt in each scenario is just instructions
	on who should pick what course)

	courses.txt
		line 18, no space between AR385W and first section number
		AR385W IS NOT STORED IN DATABASE AND WILL NOT EXIST IN 
		THE ALGORITHM
	
	faculty.txt
		line 2, missing @ in email. 
		CAIN, JASON IS NOT STORED IN DATABASE AND WILL NOT EXIST
		IN THE ALGORITHM
		This also means there will be no preference input for him,
		so his preferences can be ignored in preferences.txt
		
	prereqs.txt
		line 22, AR385W will not exist due to error in courses.txt
		
	rooms.txt
		line 5, no space between building and room number
		ARBLDG 202 IS NOT STORED IN DATABASE AND WILL NOT EXIST
		IN THE ALGORITHM
		This will probably affect the scheduling the most, probably.
	
	conflicts.txt
		line 3, incorrect specification conflict
		It will be ignored
		
	classtimes.txt
		line 3, missing / between days of week and times of day
		THIS LINE OF CLASS TIMES IS NOT STORED IN DATABASE AND WILL
		NOT EXISTS IN THE ALGORITHM
		This in conjunction with the missing room will affect the 
		scheduling tremendously.  Imagine the multi error scenarios...
