I don't know how/where to classify the following:

	Everything about:
		Project/css
			   /fpdf17
			   /generatedFiles
			   /img
			   /includes
			   /restricted
			   /setup
	
	adminSetUp.php
	conflicts.php (this may be an unneccessary file)
	doAdminSetup.php
	doFacultySetup.php
	doSetup.php
	facultyScanner.php (probably can be deleted)
	facultySetup.php
	setup.php
	timeSlots.php (another maybe unneccessary)
	
	TeamSquirtle/phpMyAdmin
		Don't have a clue what we should do with this as far
		as compiling our documentation and whatnot
		
	TeamSquirtle/Mockups
		All of our Mockups are in the Spec Doc so they may not
		need to go in the rest of our documentation.  If it does,
		I don't know where it needs to go.
		
	TeamSquirtle/Documents
		We might print out the Project Docs and include them
		Helper Docs are probably unneccessary
		And I'm assuming Cody is already keeping up with all of the
			Client/Team questions and all of our minutes.
